# Activity: Working with JSON in JavaScript

## Objective
To practice creating and understanding JSON data, focusing on key-value pairs, keys as strings enclosed in double quotes, and the different types of values.

## Instructions

### Open Your Text Editor
- Use any text editor of your choice (e.g., Notepad, Sublime Text, Visual Studio Code).

### Create a New JSON File
- Save the file with a `.json` extension (e.g., `data.json`).

### Write JSON Data
- In your JSON file, create an object that includes various types of values.
  - **Step 1:** Create an object with key-value pairs.
  - **Step 2:** Ensure all keys are strings enclosed in double quotes.
  - **Step 3:** Use different types of values: strings, numbers, objects, arrays, `true`, `false`, and `null`.

### Validate Your JSON Data
- Use an online JSON validator (e.g., JSONLint) to ensure your JSON data is correctly formatted. Copy and paste your JSON data into the validator and check for any errors.

### Load JSON Data in JavaScript
- Using node.js, load the .json file and iterate over the objects in the array.
  - Use `console.log()` to output to the Console.

### Save and Run the .js file
- Save your changes and run the .js file using NodeJS.

### Take a Screenshot
- Once you have verified that your JSON data is correctly parsed and displayed in the console, take a screenshot of the terminal showing the console output.

### Upload the Screenshot to Brightspace
- Log in to Brightspace, navigate to the appropriate course section, and upload your screenshot to the designated assignment submission area.
